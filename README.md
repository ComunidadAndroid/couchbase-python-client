pylibcouchbase
==============

This is an experimental repository for the next generation Couchbase Python
SDK which is based on [libcouchbase][1].

The couchbase.pxd was automatically generated by a [cwrap branch that uses
libclang][2].


Prerequisites
-------------

Install libcouchbase.


Building
--------

The build process uses pre-generated `.c` and `.h` files. If you have a recent 
version of Cython (> 0.18) installed, you can also generate them yourself out of
the `.pyx`, by running:

    python setup.py cythonize

As the target audience is currently developers, you probably want to install
the module locally. You can run:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

If you have compile libcouchbase yourself at a custom location, you can pass
it in via the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables. 



Running sample application
--------------------------

To run the small sample application that inserts one million documents into
a local Couchbase at the default port 8091 and a bucket called "default",
just execute:

    python basic.py


Building documentaion
---------------------

The documentation is using Sphinx and also needs the numpydoc Sphinx extension.
To build the documentation, go into the `docs` directory and run:

    make html

The HTML output can be found in `docs/build/html/`.


Running tests
-------------

If you have Python >=2.7 or >=3.2 you can run:

    python -m unittest discover -s tests

Or if you have `nose` installed, you can also run:

    nosetests


Tested platforms
----------------

So far the code has been tested on the following platforms/environments.

Linux 64-bit (with GCC):

 - Python 2.7.3
 - Python 3.2.3
 - PyPy 1.9

OSX (with clang):

 - Python 2.7


If you ran it on a different platform and it worked, please let me know and
I'll add it to the list.
